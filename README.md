customHashFunction: This function takes a string input and returns an integer hash code by processing each character's ASCII value and using bitwise operations. The result is then bounded by the table size using the modulo operation.
HashTable Class:
constructor(size): Initializes a hash table with a specified size and creates empty buckets.
hash(key): Computes the hash code for the given key using the custom hash function.
insert(key, value): Inserts a key-value pair into the hash table. If the key already exists, updates the value.
retrieve(key): Retrieves the value associated with the given key from the hash table.
delete(key): Deletes the key-value pair associated with the given key from the hash table.
Analysis
Time Complexity:
Insertion: Average O(1), worst-case O(n) if all elements hash to the same bucket.
Retrieval: Average O(1), worst-case O(n).
Deletion: Average O(1), worst-case O(n).
Space Complexity: O(n + m), where n is the number of elements and m is the size of the hash table.
Trade-offs:

Separate Chaining: Simple to implement and handles collisions efficiently. However, it may use more memory due to the linked lists.
Custom Hash Function: A simple hash function that is easy to understand and implement. However, it may not be as uniform as more complex hash functions, potentially leading to more collisions.
